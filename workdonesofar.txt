# Work Done So Far

## Structure and Build Improvements
1. Fixed the `Color` struct in `vector/shape.rs` to properly implement `Copy` trait, ensuring it can be copied directly instead of requiring cloning or dereferencing.
2. Updated the `Fill::apply` method to correctly access color fields, removing problematic dereferences.
3. Fixed gradient handling in `vector/shape.rs` by modifying how gradients are used with Cairo context.
4. Added the missing `dirs` crate dependency to `Cargo.toml` to resolve the "undeclared crate or module dirs" error.
5. Fixed issues with the `draw_path` method to properly handle control points and use appropriate Bezier curves.
6. Enhanced the `transform_path` method to correctly transform positions and control points using the provided transformation matrix.
7. Modified the `apply_stroke` method to properly set line properties based on `StrokeStyle`.

## Dependency Management
1. Added `dirs = "5.0.1"` to the project dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Ensured compatibility with existing libraries and frameworks.

## Code Cleanup
1. Removed unnecessary uses of dereferencing in gradient handling, using cloning instead.
2. Updated import statements to ensure all required modules are properly included.
3. Fixed the usage of `is_closed` field to `closed` in the path closing logic.
4. Made the code more consistent by using the same approach for handling colors throughout the codebase.

## Issues Identified
1. Multiple unresolved imports including:
   - `settings::SettingsManager`
   - `crate::core::layer::Selection`
   - `crate::core::layers`
   - `brush::BrushType`, `brush::BrushSettings`
   - `clone::CloneSettings`
   - `transform`
   - `paint`
   - `vector`
   - `crate::core::layer::LayerType`

2. Several warnings about unused imports and variables across various files.

## Next Steps
- Continue addressing unresolved imports
- Implement missing tool-related modules
- Clean up unused code to eliminate warnings
- Fix remaining build errors to achieve a successful build
